I recently graduated with a BSc in [Computer Science and Biology](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-computer-science-and-biology) at McGill University and will begin my Masters at McGill in Fall 2020.
Currently, I am working as a research intern over the summer at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en).

Background
======
During my undergraduate studies I had the great opportunity to work in five different labs in a wide range of areas, from molecular and cell biology to inverse reinforcement learning and deep learning. Professors at McGill that I have worked with include [Arnold Hayer](https://hayerlab.org/) (Biology), [Simon Gravel](http://simongravel.lab.mcgill.ca/Home.html) (Human Genetics), [Yue Li](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~yueli/) (Computer Science), and [Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/) (Computer Science). These experiences convinced me to pursue a career in research and helped motivate my current interests in bioinformatics, computational biology and genomics, and medical informatics. Furthermore, I am very curious and excited about the emergence of big data and how the development of AI, machine learning, and statistical genetics can change the field of healthcare and impact research in medicine.

Research Interests
======
My interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning began when I had the wonderful opportunity to volunteer at the very first [Montreal AI Symposium](http://montrealaisymposium.com/).

My current interests are in:
* Inverse reinforcement learning and imitation learning
* Applications of AI and Machine Learning to improve health care and clinical decision-making
* Statistical Genetics
* High-throughout genomics
